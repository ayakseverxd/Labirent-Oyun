First of all we got 2 problems and got 1 big problem.

1.) When the game starts you can move before the maze generated its needs to be fixed.

2.) When the game ends the player can move while sees the modal its needs to fixed.

3.) The big problem is i used Eller's Algorithm to generate the maze but when its generating the maze sometimes the player can get stuck and i dont know how to fix it.

I think this is all my problems but i want to hear my problems from you too so i'm sending you this.
